# A company test

This is the app I made on a recruitment proccess. They gave me the api and I built the app to consume it.

To run the app, go to the api folder and run `yarn api` and to the app folder and run `npm start` after installing the dependencies from both folders.

## Improvements since submition

- Convert to TS
- Add linters
